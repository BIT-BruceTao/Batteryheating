# Batteryheating
A systematic approach for determining the optimal battery preheating cut-off temperature for electric vehicles operating in cold climates.
Once our research paper is published officially, the strategy code and research data will be available. 
This is a strategy to determine the optimal battery heating cut-off temperature considering available battery energy and driving power demand, which can be applied to any battery heating system and EVs.
